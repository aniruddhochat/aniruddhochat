About Me
I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Indiana University, Bloomington, with a focus on software development and cloud computing. My technical skills include Object-Oriented Programming, Software Development, Databases and Data Structures, and Algorithms.

Experience
I am a Microsoft-certified professional with 5 years of experience as a technical consultant, developing software solutions for Fortune 500 clients. During this time, I have worked on customization and end-to-end implementation of the ERP software application Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, based on Azure cloud. I have developed complex integrations using web services and integration protocols such as REST, SOAP, JSON, SSIS, OData, and Azure Logic Apps. I have designed and developed financial reports and dashboards using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Power BI for business users.

Moreover, I have had ample opportunities to demonstrate and enhance my leadership, communication, and management skills while working on multiple clients and collaborating with internal and external stakeholders.

Skills
My strong analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities enable me to excel in working with technology and solving real-world problems that impact people's lives. I have a technical background in programming languages such as Java, X++, SQL, and Python. I am eager to further accelerate my potential towards full-stack software development and explore cloud technologies.

Goals
With my corporate experience, I aim to bring a comprehensive understanding to solve complex business problems and help the company meet required deadlines.
